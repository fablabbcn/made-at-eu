Paris' workshop takes place at ENSCI - Les Ateliers Fab Lab, an interdisciplinary, industrial design, graduate-level school in the heart of Paris. Founded in 1982, ENSCI-Les Ateliers is jointly governed by the Ministries of Culture and Industry. The School offers advanced study, consultancy and research in all aspects of contemporary design practice and now, after 30 years of its foundation, works around a Fablab to be in concordance with the importance of manufacturing and workshops in the process of creating and learning.
