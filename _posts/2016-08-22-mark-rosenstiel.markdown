Mark von Rosenstiel wanted to explore the way objects take on identity through the creation of abstracted objects, which he then documented through a written correspondence with them. 

He created a variety of plaster objects and one chair seat along with a selection of writings and sketches.

<b>Mark Rosenstiel is an artist</b> curently working mostly with installations and sculptures augmented with technology. The concepts of his work draw heavily from mathematics and mathematical­ based thinkers. He likes to examine how the internal/external space of people can be explored in an emotionally relevant way using mathematical algorithms.
