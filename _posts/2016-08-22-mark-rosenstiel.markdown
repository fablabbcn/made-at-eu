I wanted to explore the way objects take on identity through the creation of abstracted objects, which I then documented through a written correspondence with them. I created a variety of plaster objects and one chair seat along with a selection of writings and sketches. This is very different than what I set out to do based on a couple factors that I didn’t foresee. The first of these is the time it takes to CNC mill a fairly small form factor object. I originally thought I would have time to play around with some designs and then go about creating 10 or so objects from the best of my prototypes. In reality to mill a small plaster block on both sides takes a day; to mill larger found objects on both sides would take about a day and half. With other people slotted for machine time and the ramp­up to getting oriented with the lab, I realized quickly that I wouldn’t have time to create this series of objects, much less embed them with tech. This ended up pushing me to focus more on software creation and conceptual narrative, which I also enjoyed.
