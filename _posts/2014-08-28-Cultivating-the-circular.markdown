description: From PITO (Product In - Trash Out) to DIDO (Data In - Data Out). Closed material cycles that keep atoms flowing within the city; trash is the new gold, from where we make our new objects; nano-assembled structures that produce no trash, micro-Lego pieces that can assembly objects and electronic circuits that we can reconfigure to become anything we want and need. The Spiral Economy brings a direction to the Circular Economy, from an infinite loop to growth based on technology advances. We now make things with machines and materials, which are designed using digital tools; we will then use nano-scale assemblers to put together nano-Lego pieces to construct our world, from computers to buildings; finally we will grow things instead of making them, materials, machines and information are the same thing, an infinite set of possible configurations to program objects, cultivate them and reuse them to nurture new ones.
