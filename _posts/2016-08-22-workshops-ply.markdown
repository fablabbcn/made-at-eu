Plymouth's workshop takes place at FabLab Plymouth, which is a digital fabrication laboratory based on the Plymouth College of Art Campus. This facility is part of the international FabLab network which includes over 250 Labs across more than 30 countries. Fab Lab Plymouth is unique in that it is situated next to the craft and design workshop complex which creates the perfect setting for traditional crafts and new technologies to merge with exciting consequences.
