Budapest's workshop takes place at the FabLab Budapest, where the motto is "Materialise your dreams!". It's an individual Fab Lab in the city's downtown.  In cooperation with the Asimov Foundation they host the first BioHack space in the country. Tiny but growing and open for everybody from kids to crazy scientists.
