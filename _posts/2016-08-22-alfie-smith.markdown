I aim to refine and perfect the creation of Pate De Verre pieces using a delta printer to create unique forms. Currently these pieces would be both sculptural and useful but this may change dependant on how my work at Wolverhampton University progresses. 
This would particularly focus on the firing techniques which have been an issue for other artists that have attempted this technique. It is a very new process and could potentially create a refined form of glassworking. I intend to create a range of tests and final pieces using a pate de verre paste as a medium in a delta 3D printer. Also I hope that the research gained from this practice would be submitted to the crafts council, expanding the knowledge of digital crafts in glass making.

I anticipate using traditional techniques to aid the printing and firing of the pieces. Also, research in to the recipe of Pate De Verre will require traditional techniques to create an ideal recipe for an effective paste.

I intend to use the digital tools and processes to improve and modify the delta printer to create a more effective machine. Using autodesk software to create relevant files ideal for printing the glass paste. Also, the processes may involve the introduction of supports and props to support the printing and firing of the pieces, this will involve the use of 3D printers or CAD-CAM machinery.
