description: We live in a decentralised world, in which centers of power decide and execute in our behalf; we choose who can represent us in order to take decisions for us, we use information systems controlled by super-nodes of control and censor whatever it is not proper, profitable or dangerous for the established systems. We have financial centers, manufacturing centers, raw materials centers, and the like; we live in a polycentric world. .
