One of the priorities of the Made@Eu project is the organisation of three exhibitions, which, together with the extra european diffusion activities, demonstrate that the Made@EU project is attuned to the need to support international cultural activities, such as for instance exhibitions, exchanges and festivals. These exhibitions are directed not only to designers and members of the creative community but also to the general public in order to direct interest of consumers to Made@EU online platform and to European creative works in general.
