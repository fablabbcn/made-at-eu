Elastica is a wearable suit developed with low cost, DIY embroidered stretch sensors that functions as an interface for the performer augmenting his body, creating sound and data visualisation. 

Through the use of E-textile and conductive thread the body biometrics allow performers to capture data of their behaviour, enhancing how they engage with a external environment. 

After a study on the anatomy of the body and the expansion of the muscles, the stretch sensors are integrated to a tailored suit that through Wifi communicates with MAXmsp interface to generate audio/visual output. 

Elastica becomes an interface instrument for the performer, creating real-time dialogue between fashion and dance, wearable technologies and data visualisation.
