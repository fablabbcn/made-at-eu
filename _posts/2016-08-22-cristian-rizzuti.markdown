Elastica is a wearable suit , developed with low cost, DIY embroidered stretch sensors that functions as an interface for the performer, augmenting his body, creating sound and data visualisation. Through the use of E-textile and conductive threads, the body biometrics allow performers to capture data of their behaviour, enhancing how they engage with a external environment. 

After a study on the anatomy of the body and the expansion of the muscles, the stretch sensors are integrated to a tailored suit that through Wifi communicates with MAXmsp interface to generate audio/visual output. Elastica becomes an interface instrument for the performer, creating real-time dialogue between fashion and dance, wearable technologies and data visualisation. - See more at: http://fablabbcn.org/news/2016/05/12/madeateu.html#sthash.UoTVrkH6.dpuf
