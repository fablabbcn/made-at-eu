Barcelona's workshop takes place at the Green Fab Lab in Valldaura, a project promoted by IaaC (Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia) and part of the Fab City network. The Green Fab Lab works towards the creation of a self-sufficient habitat and research centre at Can Valldaura. Located in the Collserola Natural Park, in the heart of the metropolitan area of Barcelona it has laboratories for the production of energy, food and things, and develops projects and academic programmes in association with leading research centres around the world. 

Fab Lab Barcelona, which is part of the Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia, supports different educational and research programs related with the multiple scales of the human habitat. It is also the headquarters of the global coordination of the Fab Academy program in collaboration with the Fab Foundation and the MITâ€™s Center for Bits and Atoms; the Fab Academy is a distributed platform of education and research in which each Fab Labs operates as a classroom and the planet as the campus of the largest University in construction in the world, where students learn about the principles, applications and implications of digital manufacturing technology.
