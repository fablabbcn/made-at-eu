The participants selected for the residencies fall within the target group of the Made@EU project, namely designers, craftspeople and artists. They are tasked with the development of a project which represents their background, previous body of work and area of expertise whilst at the same time ingrates the digital fabrication techniques learned at the workshop session offered to them.

Thus, participants are granted access to the digital fabrication equipment available not only at the partners institution where they are located but if required, also to specific equipment available at the facilities of other partners. They also receive continuous guidance and support from the local digital fabrication team as well as experts from the other institutions.

Residencies take place simultaneously in all partner cities, with a duration between 4 and 8 weeks depending on the complexity and ambition of each project.
