Cuttance aim is to produce a series of intricate cast objects based on his Faceture casting process but, by utilising Plymouth College of Arts Digital capabilities, take the process into a new direction in terms of the form and scale of the pieces.

By cutting larger, more intricate moulds using Plymouth College of Art's digital equipment, he uses these digitally made moulds to cast sculptural pieces using water-based resin; each piece is unique in its form.

Cuttance thinks that digital technologies should have a light footprint within craft, and not be used to replace skill, but to complement the maker; To provide the maker with opportunities which aren't possible by hand. 

There are many people in the design/make field using technology, and he hopes that this project is another example of using digital technolgy in this limited way. 

He claims he is wary of digital technology, but have been excited and impressed with what forms he can now make using the processes he employed. Cuttance feels he can use it in future projects to push the aesthetic of his work further while maintaining the 'hand-made' integrity of his work.

<b>Phil Cuttance is a designer/maker</b> based in a shared studio in London. He moved to London six years ago from New Zealand where he had worked as a furniture designer for years, and set up his studio full time on arrival. He makes by hand most of the objects he produces in his studio. Cuttance occasionally collaborates with other makers/design brands and has worked with many materials and processes, but is currently spending the majority of his time casting objects using his Faceture process, his most successful project to date.
