I am aiming to produce a series of  intricate, cast objects based on my Faceture casting process but, by utilising Plymouth College of Arts Digital capabilities, take the process into a new direction in terms of the form and scale of the pieces. By cutting larger, more intricate moulds using Plymouth College of Art's digital equipment, I will then use these digitally made moulds to cast sculptural pieces using water-based resin; each piece will be unique in its form.

After much experimentation I came up with a moulding technique that is not resolved but I think has exciting potential for me to push further. I think that digital technologies should have a light footprint within craft , and not be used to replace skill, but to complement the maker; To provide the maker with opportunities which aren't possible by hand. 

There are many people in the design/make field using technology, and I hope that this project is another example of using digital technolgy in this limited way. I am obviously wary of digital technology , but have been excited and impressed with what forms I can now make using the processes I employed. I feel I can use it in future projects to push the aesthetic of my work further while maintaining the 'hand-made' integrity of my work.
