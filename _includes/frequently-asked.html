			<div class="pregunta">
				<h3 class="section-heading"> What are the objectives of Fab City?</h3>
				<p class="about"> 
					FAB City is a new urban model of transforming and shaping cities that shifts how they source and use materials from  ‘Products In Trash Out’ (PITO) to ‘Data In Data Out’ (DIDO). This means that more production occurs inside the city, along with recycling materials and meeting local needs through local inventiveness. A city’s imports and exports would mostly be found in the form of data (information, knowledge, design, code).

			<div class="pregunta">	
				<h3 class="section-heading">What is the structure of Fab City?</h3>
				<p class="about"> 
					The Fab City project operates within the Fab Lab network, using it as a global infrastructure and knowledge source for the transformation of cities. We propose a new approach to urban regeneration by starting from the innovative capacity of citizens.The FAB City project acts at two different scales, global and local. At local scale, the FAB City project focuses on developing physical products at a local community scale, while data (digital models, files, code) describing the object and necessary for the machines in order to make it, are shared globally by Internet. Citizens are the main actors for this transformation, and their participation can be supported by the development of educational programs, which include local Fab Academies, training policy makers, and introducing digital fabrication in schools.The FAB City initiative promotes a new economy model based on the increase of local innovation ecosystems, generated by the support of local startups and companies, while creating a connection with larger industries. At the global scale, the FAB City project aims to create a global inventory composed by an active network of productive cities, sharing knowledge, projects and information, while training policy makers in the Fab Academy.

		<div class="pregunta">		
			<h3 class="section-heading"> What are the benefits of joining the network?</h3>
			<p class="about"> 
				The first beneficiaries of the Fab City project will be the citizens of the cities that join the initiative and the global network of makers that develop solutions for urban problems. However, we aim to have a bigger impact in other communities of innovation since the Fab City is an open source project, which makes all the content produced available to the general public.

		<div class="pregunta">	
			<h3 class="section-heading"> How can my city be involved?</h3>
			<p class="about"> 
				The Fab City project will help civic leaders develop locally productive cities in collaboration with global networks of makers. Fab Lab innovators will find a channel for their inventions to connect to real problems, opening opportunities for businesses, research and education through projects. Our aim is to enable makers produce change in cities that could be measured in a common index.

			<div class="pregunta">	
				<h3 class="section-heading">What commitments are required to be part of Fab City?</h3>
				<p class="about"> 
					Each city will identify the following metrics: 
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Existing Fab Labs and makerspaces</li>	
					<li>Amount of energy produced (local and imported) and consumed</li>	
					<li>Amount of food produced (local and imported) and consumed</li>	
					<li>Imports and exports of goods and products</li>	
					<li>Employment rates</li>	
					<li>Waste produced and recycled</li>
				</ul>	
				<p class="about"> 
					Identifying a common set of indicators will allow comparison of performance in each city, which will  underpin policy, infrastructure and strategies to revert or change trends and build a comprehensive and accurate Fab City Index.

		<div class="pregunta">	
			<h3 class="section-heading"> What is a Fab Lab?</h3>
			<p class="about"> 
				A Fab Lab is a technical prototyping platform for innovation and invention, providing stimulus for local entrepreneurship. A Fab Lab is also a platform for learning and innovation: a place to play, to create, to learn, to mentor and to invent. For a complete description of fab labs we invite you to visit the <a href="http://www.fabfoundation.org/fab-labs/what-is-a-fab-lab/" target="_blank">Fab Foundation website</a>, and to have an idea of how the fab lab network works you can visit <a href="http://fablabs.io/." target="_blank">http://fablabs.io/.</a>

		<div class="pregunta">	
			<h3 class="section-heading"> What is the role of Fab Labs and other makerspaces in a Fab City?</h3>
			<p class="about"> 
				The main structure of a FAB City consists in having a distributed responsive network of Fab Labs, placed among the urban area to guarantee access to digital fabrication technology for every citizen. Using their network as the main connector for the makerspace, cities can promote a series of solutions both from bottom up and top down.

			<div class="pregunta">	
				<h3 class="section-heading">Do Fab Labs have to have links with a university?</h3>
				<p class="about"> 
					Fab labs are spontaneous realities, and, though their roots are directly connected to a university - the MIT -, actually they are not required to be linked to universities. However, it is important to remember that in order to become a FAB City, education (from primary to higher education programs) is one of the basic field of action, and Fab Labs are the main promoters in spreading and teaching digital manufacturing and leading projects in the FAB City network. (?) At least one of the fab lab in your city must host a Fab Academy Program (?)
